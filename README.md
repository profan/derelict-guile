derelict-guile
===============
This is a binding to libguile 2.0.11, nothing more than a wrapper over the existing C API, with some replacements for things that were macros in the original C API, which couldn't be used directly with D's C FFI.

Parts are still missing, so don't use this quite yet, further instructions to follow.
